const productName = "potato";

const quantity = 3;
const available = true;

// const , let , var we should use this keyword to write a variable. when we write a variable we should avoid some mistake like we should not space between the name, at the start point we should not use any number but we can use $ or _ . but the standard way to write variable name we can use camelcasing like productName. 

console.log("product- " + productName, "price- " + productPrice, "quantity-" + quantity, "available- " + available)
